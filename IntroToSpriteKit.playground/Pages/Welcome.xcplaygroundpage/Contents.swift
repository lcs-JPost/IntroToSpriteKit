 # Intro to SpriteKit
 
 UIKit is a collection of functionality that Apple provides software developers so that they can author iOS apps more easily.
 
 UIKit offers classes such as UITextField, UIButton, and UILabel, which we've made use of in prior tasks.  UIKit offers more advanced classes like UITableView, which are very common in iOS apps. For example:
 
 ![UITableView](UITableViewExamples.png "Some examples of UITableView in various iOS apps.")
 
 SpriteKit is a collection of functionality that Apple provides software developers so that they can more easily author a different type of app: an animation, or a game.
