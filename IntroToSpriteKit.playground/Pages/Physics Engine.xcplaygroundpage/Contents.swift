 Immediately below is code similar to what we explored on a prior page.
 
 Read past this section of code to learn how SpriteKit makes it possible for sprites to interact in a realistic fashion.

// Required frameworks
import PlaygroundSupport    // Allows playground to show live view
import SpriteKit            // Provides 2D graphics classes

// Define the animation size and scene
let frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 525, height: 320)
var scene = SKScene(size: frame.size)

// Define, configure, and present the scene

 ### Setting the scene
 
 In the code below, a sprite that contains a cliff and a bit of a ramp are positioned at the bottom left corner of the scene.
 
 A boulder is positioned near the top left corner of the screen.
 
 Some crates are stacked at the bottom of the hill.
 
 And yes, all of these graphics are hand-drawn by Mr. Gordon â€“ the artist who brought you the camelCase camel:
 
 ![camelCase](camelCase.jpeg)
 
 Run the code to see this scene.
 
 - Callout(Consider):
     What if we could have the boulder roll down the hill?
 
 */

// Create and position a boulder sprite near the top left corner of the screen
let boulder = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "boulder")
boulder.position = CGPoint(x: 50, y: scene.size.height - 25)
scene.addChild(boulder)

// Create and position the hill
let hill = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "hill")
hill.anchorPoint = CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0)      // Position sprite via it's bottom left corner, instead of                                            // it's centre point
hill.position = CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0)
scene.addChild(hill)

// Position six crates in a pyramid
for i in 1...3 {
    for j in 0...3 - i {
        let crate = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "crate")
        crate.position = CGPoint(x: 500 - i * 50 - j * 25, y: 25 + j * 50)
        scene.addChild(crate)
    }
}

     What type of animations could you imagine creating using the SpriteKit Physics engine? What types of games?
